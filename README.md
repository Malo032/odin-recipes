# odin-recipes
First project of the foundations course of TOP

This project tests my ability to create a website with HTML from scratch.
At the end, I will be able to put together a main page and sub pages,
work with an HTML boilerplate,
work with text and different headers, paragraphs and body text,
work with lists,
work with images and links,
and commit messages to Git to commit my changes.
